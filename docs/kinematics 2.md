### 11. Projectile Motion with Air Resistance:
- A ball is thrown vertically upward with an initial velocity of 30 m/s. Assuming air resistance is proportional to the square of the velocity, calculate the maximum height reached and the time it takes to return to the ground.
### 13. Relative Motion with Multiple Objects:
- A train is traveling at 80 km/h. A person walks from the front of the train to the back at a speed of 5 km/h relative to the train. What is the person's speed relative to the ground?
### 14. Free Fall with Initial Velocity:
- An object is thrown downward from a height of 50 meters with an initial velocity of 10 m/s. Calculate its final velocity and the time it takes to reach the ground.
### 15. Inclined Plane with Friction and Initial Velocity:
- A block slides down an inclined plane with an angle of 45 degrees. The coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.3. The block starts from rest at the top of the plane. Calculate its final velocity at the bottom and the time it takes to reach the bottom.
### 16. Simple Harmonic Motion with Damping:
- A mass attached to a spring oscillates back and forth with damping. The damping coefficient is 0.5 Ns/m. Calculate the amplitude of the oscillation after 10 seconds, assuming the initial amplitude is 0.2 meters.
### 17. Rotational Motion with Variable Acceleration:
- A wheel starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at a rate of 2 rad/s² for 5 seconds. Then, it decelerates uniformly at a rate of 1 rad/s² until it comes to a stop. Calculate the total angular displacement of the wheel.
### 18. Two-Dimensional Motion with a Target:
- A cannonball is fired at an angle of 45 degrees above the horizontal with an initial velocity of 100 m/s. A target is located 1000 meters away. Calculate the angle at which the cannonball should be fired to hit the target.
### 22. Projectile Motion from a Moving Helicopter:

- A helicopter is hovering at a constant altitude of 500 meters. A missile is fired from the helicopter with an initial velocity of 200 m/s at an angle of 45 degrees below the horizontal. Calculate the horizontal distance the missile travels before hitting the ground and the time it takes to reach the ground.

### 23. Projectile Motion from a Moving Tank:

- A tank is moving at a constant speed of 15 m/s. A cannonball is fired from the tank at an angle of 60 degrees above the horizontal with an initial velocity of 100 m/s relative to the tank. Calculate the horizontal range of the cannonball and the time it takes to hit the ground.

### 24. Projectile Motion from a Moving Car:

- A car is driving at a constant speed of 25 m/s. A person throws a ball out of the car window with an initial velocity of 10 m/s at an angle of 30 degrees above the horizontal relative to the car. Calculate the horizontal range of the ball and the time it takes to hit the ground.

### 25. Projectile Motion from a Moving Rocket:

- A rocket is launched vertically upward with an initial velocity of 2000 m/s. After reaching its maximum height, it fires a missile horizontally with an initial velocity of 1000 m/s relative to the rocket. Calculate the horizontal distance the missile travels before hitting the ground and the total time it takes from the launch of the rocket to the impact of the missile.

### 27. Projectile Motion from a Moving Aircraft Carrier:

- An aircraft carrier is moving at a constant speed of 30 knots (approximately 15.4 m/s). An airplane takes off from the aircraft carrier with an initial velocity of 100 m/s relative to the carrier. Calculate the horizontal range of the airplane before it lands on the carrier and the time it takes to land.
