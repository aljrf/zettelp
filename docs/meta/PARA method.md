# PARA method

- Projects --folders inside area
- Areas -- folder
- Resources -- folder ref outside area tagged as ref and as area
- Archive -- project folders move to folder archive inside area

- Area1
	- Project2
	- Project3
	- Archive
		- Project1
- Area2
	- Project3
	- Project4
- Ref



## Folders vs tags

- Tags are for "grouping" notes arbitrarily that have nothing else in common.
- Folders preserve a grouping of files _outside_ of Obsidian

Projects belong in folders
In general, create folders for
- Software, tools, libraries, etc. that require more than one note (e.g., Python, Pandas, JavaScript, Obsidian)
- Major content areas (e.g., web development, statistics, fitness).


Therefore:
- Use folders like
	- bod, lana, psi, them, we, kid 
	- Create a parent note with the same note as the folder to act as moc
	- Use parent property instead of subfoldering inside a folder
- Use tags like *todo*, *book*, *learn*, *tracker* as metastructure across folders
