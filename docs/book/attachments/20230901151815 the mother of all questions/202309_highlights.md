Go ahead and attend a course of lectures in science, Jefferson recommended. But he then added, ""While you are attending these courses, you can proceed by yourself in a regular series of historical reading. It would be a waste of time to attend a professor of this. It is to be acquired from books, and if you pursue it by yourself, you can accommodate it to your other reading so as to fill up those chasms of time not otherwise appropriated.""1 Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to Thomas"

The Mother of All Questions	Rebecca Solnit	53	2023-08-29 16:50:43	"In 1977, Audre Lorde addressed the Modern Language Association with her landmark talk and essay considering race, gender, and orientation together, “The Transformation of Silence Into Language and Action” (published in 1984). It’s a brief, dense, aphoristic essay with some of the urgency of a manifesto:
My silences had not protected me. Your silence will not protect you. But for every real word spoken, for every attempt I had ever made to speak those truths for which I am still seeking, I had made contact with other women while we examined the words to fit a world in which we all believed, bridging our differences. And it was the concern and caring of all those women which gave me strength.
Lorde addressed the way that breaking silence was not only an act of courage but also of creation: “What are the words you do not yet have? What do you need to say? . . . Each of us is here now because in one way or another we share a commitment to language and to the power of language, and to the reclaiming of that language which has been made to work against us.”"

It’s how we make the world.

we bought from the boy
at the bend in the road where we turned toward
signs painted Peaches.
From laden boughs, from hands,
from sweet fellowship in the bins,
comes nectar at the roadside, succulent
peaches we devour, dusty skin and all,
comes the familiar dust of summer, dust we eat.
O, to take what we love inside,
to carry within us an orchard, to eat
not only the skin, but the shade,
not only the sugar, but the days, to hold
the fruit in our hands, adore it, then bite into
the round jubilance of peach.
There are days we live
as if death were nowhere
in the background; from joy
to joy to joy, from wing to wing,
from blossom to blossom to
impossible blossom, to sweet impossible blossom"	"li young lee

Could Have
It could have happened.
It had to happen.
It happened earlier. Later.
Nearer. Farther off.
It happened, but not to you.
You were saved because you were the first.
You were saved because you were the last.
Alone. With others.
On the right. The left.
Because it was raining. Because of the shade.
Because the day was sunny.
You were in luck—there was a forest.
You were in luck—there were no trees.
You were in luck—a rake, a hook, a beam, a brake,
a jamb, a turn, a quarter inch, an instant.
You were in luck—just then a straw went floating by.
As a result, because, although, despite.
What would have happened if a hand, a foot,
within an inch, a hairsbreadth from
an unfortunate coincidence.
So you’re here? Still dizzy from another dodge, close shave, reprieve?
One hole in the net and you slipped through?
I couldn’t be more shocked or speechless.
Listen,
how your heart pounds inside me."

I’m Glad You’ve Lost Your Mind Over Someone and It’s Not Me
I’m glad you’ve lost your mind over someone and it’s not me,
I’m glad I’ve lost my mind and it’s not over you
and that the heavy globe of the Earth
will never float away from under our feet.
I’m glad that we can be silly and funny—
can act however we want and not worry over what we say,
and that neither one of us blushes like drowning in a wave,
when our sleeves happen to slightly touch.
I’m also glad that you casually kiss someone else in front of me,
and that you don’t curse me to hellfire for not kissing you.
I’m glad that my sweet name, my sweet, is not
the name you speak, not day nor night—in vain …
and that never will they break the silence of the church
by singing out over us: Hallelujah!
I’m grateful, with all my heart and hand,
for your knowing not that you are in love with me,
and for all the peaceful nights,
for the rarity of our being together at sunset hours,
for our nonwalks under the moon,
for the sun not being over our two heads,
because you’ve lost your mind—oh well—not over me,
because I’ve lost my mind—oh well—not over you."	poem Maria Tsvetaeva

You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I’ll rise.
Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I’ve got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.
Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I’ll rise.
Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,
Weakened by my soulful cries?
Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don’t you take it awful hard
’Cause I laugh like I’ve got gold mines
Diggin’ in my own backyard.
You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I’ll rise.
Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I’ve got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?
Out of the huts of history’s shame
I rise
Up from a past that’s rooted in pain
I rise
I’m a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise
I rise

Buddhism 101	Arnie Kozak	43	2022-08-28 22:53:35	Whatever this self appears to be, it is not solid and is always changing.	
Buddhism 101	Arnie Kozak	43	2022-08-28 22:58:19	Self is a process just like everything else. And furthermore, what you take to be yourself is a metaphor for identity in that this moment is based upon previous similar moments from the past or future similar moments from an anticipated future. This process of comparison gives rise to a solid self or an ego that is more like a thing than a process. In our earthly life, a lot of energy is invested into this ego self. It must be identified with and protected; self-esteem must be enhanced, and this is often done in obsessional ways.	
Buddhism 101	Arnie Kozak	43	2022-08-28 23:00:22	The three fires are greed (craving, desire, thirst), hatred (aversion, aggression), and delusion (ignorance, confusion). These are also known as the three poisons.	
Buddhism 101	Arnie Kozak	44	2022-08-28 23:03:31	For greed he suggests generosity (dana). For hatred he suggests loving friendliness (metta) and compassion (karuna). For delusion he suggests the possibility of wisdom (prajna)	
Buddhism 101	Arnie Kozak	44	2022-08-28 23:03:53	"The five aggregates he named are as follows:
1. The aggregate of matter (eye, ear, nose, throat, hand, etc.).
2. The aggregate of feelings (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral).
3. The aggregate of perception.
4. The aggregate of volitions or mental formations.
5. The aggregate of consciousness (response)."	
Buddhism 101	Arnie Kozak	45	2022-08-28 23:09:15	the fifth aggregate, consciousness, depends on all the other aggregates for its existence. The action or response you make based on the intention you had, which is based on your perception of your senses from your body, is solely dependent on each of the preceding phenomena. This is the Buddha’s teaching of dependent origination.	
Buddhism 101	Arnie Kozak	46	2022-09-20 23:39:21	You suffer because you reach out for certain things, push other things away, and generally neglect to appreciate that everything is changing constantly (anicca).

Buddhism 101	Arnie Kozak	43	2022-08-28 22:53:35	Whatever this self appears to be, it is not solid and is always changing.	
Buddhism 101	Arnie Kozak	43	2022-08-28 22:58:19	Self is a process just like everything else. And furthermore, what you take to be yourself is a metaphor for identity in that this moment is based upon previous similar moments from the past or future similar moments from an anticipated future. This process of comparison gives rise to a solid self or an ego that is more like a thing than a process. In our earthly life, a lot of energy is invested into this ego self. It must be identified with and protected; self-esteem must be enhanced, and this is often done in obsessional ways.	
Buddhism 101	Arnie Kozak	43	2022-08-28 23:00:22	The three fires are greed (craving, desire, thirst), hatred (aversion, aggression), and delusion (ignorance, confusion). These are also known as the three poisons.	
Buddhism 101	Arnie Kozak	44	2022-08-28 23:03:31	For greed he suggests generosity (dana). For hatred he suggests loving friendliness (metta) and compassion (karuna). For delusion he suggests the possibility of wisdom (prajna)	
Buddhism 101	Arnie Kozak	44	2022-08-28 23:03:53	"The five aggregates he named are as follows:
1. The aggregate of matter (eye, ear, nose, throat, hand, etc.).
2. The aggregate of feelings (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral).
3. The aggregate of perception.
4. The aggregate of volitions or mental formations.
5. The aggregate of consciousness (response)."	
Buddhism 101	Arnie Kozak	45	2022-08-28 23:09:15	the fifth aggregate, consciousness, depends on all the other aggregates for its existence. The action or response you make based on the intention you had, which is based on your perception of your senses from your body, is solely dependent on each of the preceding phenomena. This is the Buddha’s teaching of dependent origination.	
Buddhism 101	Arnie Kozak	46	2022-09-20 23:39:21	You suffer because you reach out for certain things, push other things away, and generally neglect to appreciate that everything is changing constantly (anicca).

But death is surrounded by an infinite fog on an ocean without end. It is perhaps simplistic to say it, but one can understand death only in terms of its opposite, life. For me, it was always the not returning part of it that made me start up in the dark, suffocating. Yet after my father, who had never even ridden on an airplane, disappeared into that fog, it began to take on other meanings, and I began to dimly see that the not returning part of it is there with us all along, inside us, from the moment we appear into the bewildering new stimuli of the world, even from the moment we start to form out of the fertilized ovum. Now that my mother is gone, it is clearer still. There is only forward motion, and there always was only forward motion. There was never any turning back

On the show, this was the actual world that the adults constructed around us. We were categorized as characters. Our social dramas were set to generic acoustic ballads and pop punk. Our identities were given a clear narrative importance. All of this is a narcissist’s fantasy come true. “There’s a saying we have in reality,” Jess, the producer, told me, while we were sitting in Midtown. “Everyone signs. Most people want to be famous. Everyone thinks they could be a better Kardashian than the Kardashians. You see it now, with these apps, everyone likes to have an audience. Everyone thinks they deserve one.”
