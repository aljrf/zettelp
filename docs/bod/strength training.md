Do 100 of anything each day.


1. **Push:** You can do any of the numerous press variations (military press, floor press, etc.).  You can even combine push and counter-rotation by doing a one-sided floor press. If you don’t want to use a kettlebell, you can do pushups (of which there are numerous variations).
2. **Pull:** Any of the row variations (rows, renegade rows, single-leg rows, batwings, etc.) or pullups fall into the pull category.
3. **Hinge:** Deadlifts, swings, cleans, and snatches all are hinges.
4. **Squat:** Goblet squats and front squats are the most common. The more practiced strength students can perform pistols (weighted or unweighted).
5. **Loaded Carry:** According to Dan John, this one’s a game changer. Farmers carries, racked carries, waiter’s walk (overhead carries).
6. **Rotation:** Russian twist, ribbons, overhead rotation (kettlbell locked out overhead and rotate from your spine, not hips).
7. **Counter-rotation:** One-sided suitcase deadlifts, one sided floor presses, renegade rows, one-arm swings, alternating swings.
