# Kinematics 1
1. Projectile Motion: A ball is thrown horizontally from a cliff 20 meters high with a speed of 10 m/s. Calculate its time of flight, horizontal range, and vertical velocity at impact.
2. Circular Motion:
A car is traveling around a circular track with a radius of 50 meters at a constant speed of 20 m/s. Determine its centripetal acceleration and the minimum coefficient of static friction required to prevent skidding.
3. Relative Motion:
A boat is traveling upstream against a current of 2 m/s. Its speed relative to the water is 8 m/s. Calculate its total speed relative to the shore.
4. Free Fall:
An object is dropped from 100 meters. find its final velocity and the time it takes to reach the ground.
5. Inclined Plane:
A block slides down an inclined plane with an angle of 30 degrees. The coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.2. Calculate its acceleration, final velocity, and the time it takes to reach the bottom, assuming it starts from rest.
6. Simple Harmonic Motion:
A mass of 2 kg is attached to a spring with a spring constant of 100 N/m. It oscillates back and forth with an amplitude of 0.1 meters. Calculate its period, frequency, maximum velocity, and maximum acceleration.
7. Rotational Motion: A wheel starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at a rate of 2 rad/s². Calculate its angular velocity, angular displacement, and centripetal acceleration of a point on its rim after 5 seconds, assuming the wheel has a radius of 0.5 meters.
8. Two-Dimensional Motion:
A projectile is launched with an initial velocity of 30 m/s at an angle of 60 degrees above the horizontal. Determine its max height, time of flight, and horizontal range.
9. Constant Acceleration:
A car accelerates uniformly from rest at a rate of 2 m/s². Calculate its final velocity, displacement, and average velocity after 10 seconds.
10. Instantaneous Velocity and Acceleration:
Given a position-time graph:
At t = 2 seconds, the position is 5 meters.
At t = 4 seconds, the position is 12 meters.
At t = 6 seconds, the position is 25 meters. Determine the instantaneous velocity and acceleration at t = 4 seconds.
