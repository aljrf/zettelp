## Preparation Strategies

(This is where you identify, organize, and consolidate material.)


-   Develop study sheets or study guides
-   Make flash cards
-   Outline/summarize material
-   Develop [concept maps](https://live-learning-strategies-center.pantheonsite.io/how-to-study/studying-for-and-taking-exams/concept-maps/) or charts (make sure you use use linking terms)
-   List the steps in a complex process or develop a flow chart
-   Make a list of 20 topics that could be on the exam. Be able to explain why you think they might be on the test.
-   Predict (and answer!) practice test/essay questions
-   Answer questions at the end of the chapter (that werenâ€™t assigned as HW)
-   Prepare material for a study group

## Review Strategies

(This is where you self-test and evaluate your learning.)


-   Explain concepts to others
-   Use your quizlets or flash cards
-   Work problems (no looking at answer keys!)
-   Take self-tests (try to mimic test conditions if you can)
-   Recite from memory (better yet, tell your cat or favorite pillow) your list of 20 topics that could be on the exam.
-   Work the problems that you missed on quizzes, HW, or questions at the end of the chapter
-   Outline answers to essay questions from memory
-   Write a full sample essay
-   Explain material to group members or study partners
