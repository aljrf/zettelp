# Problem solving
* Start with a drawing if you don't know where to start. 
* Find what form the answer is (number of what, units).
* Pinpoint the start point. It must be a known thing.
* Draw a map if you are not sure how to get where you need to be.
* The path must jump from known thing to unknown thing through known relations. Tarzan-like.
* Write neatly.
* Use actual words and sentences to explain the steps you take.
