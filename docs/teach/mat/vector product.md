# vector product

$a\times b=\begin{vmatrix}     i & a_{1} & b_{1}\\     j & a_{2} & b_{2}\\    k  & a_{3} & b_{3}\end{vmatrix}$

## Interpretation:

It's a vector that is perpendicular to the vectors and with a length equal to the parallelogram defined by them.

If we multiply $\begin{pmatrix}  a_1 & b_1\\     a_2 & b_2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}c_{11}&c_{21}\\c_{12}&c_{22}\end{pmatrix}$ the $\vec{c}$ vectors get transformed and their area is altered. The determinant is a measure of the factor by which the area is changed, and its sign is negative if the vectors have been flipped.

## triple product

If we then scalar multiply by a third vector, the result is the volume of the parallelepiped produced by the three of them.

that is the same as computing the determinant:

$a\times b=\begin{vmatrix}     \hat{i} & a_1 & b_1\\     \hat{j} & a_2 & b_2\\    \hat{k}  & a_3 & b_3\end{vmatrix}$


The volume of the parallelepiped is $\begin{vmatrix}     c_1 & a_1 & b_1\\     c_2 & a_2 & b_2\\    c_3  & a_3 & b_3\end{vmatrix}$

Then 

If we multiply $\begin{pmatrix}  a_1 & b_1\\     a_2 & b_2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}c_{11}&c_{12}\\c_{21}&c_{22}\end{pmatrix}$ the $\vec{c}$ vectors get transformed and their area is altered. The determinant is a measure of the factor by which the area is changed, and its sign is negative if the vectors have been flipped.
