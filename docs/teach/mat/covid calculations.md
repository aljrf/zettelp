8.15 is the influenza AND pneumonia death rate per 100k per year for Spain

That's 80 per million

COVID has killed 1400 per million in Spain during the past year.

That's ~17 times the morbidity.

If we take into account that there's at the very least a 10 dB decrease in flu deaths this year due to COVID countermeasures, it is safe to assume that COVID would still have been 10 dB worse if there was no countermeasure in place.

That means that without any lockdowns or masks, COVID is about 170 times worse than the flu.

That is to say, COVID is not your average flu.
