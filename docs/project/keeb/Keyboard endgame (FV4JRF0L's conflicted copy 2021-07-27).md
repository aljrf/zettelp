# Layout
https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods

- Solve the meaning issue:
	- No permanent layers
- Solve the thumb problem: home row mods
- jkl; -> shift ctrl alt graphic 
- graphic alt ctrl shift -> asdf GASC vs GACS
- Use also space as a mod
- Use combos for special keys:
	- ESC
	- tilde tilda (`~)
	- [] - = \
- layers:
	- cursor and mouse
	- numbers
	- workman layer 

- god of layout https://github.com/precondition/dactyl-manuform-keymap
	- `TD_DOT`: Double tap the dot key to produce .spaceOne-Shot Shift to quickly flow from one sentence to another.
	- Shift+Backspace: Delete
	- `CAPS_WORD`: Capitalizes the next word you type and then automatically toggle off Caps Lock. Perfect for typing all-caps IDENTIFIERS in code.
